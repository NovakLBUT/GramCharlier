# GramCharlier
Software tool GramCharlier contains multiple functionalities for semi-probabilistic analysis of structures. 
The main functionality is an estimation of a probability distribution of the quantity of interest (typically material characterstic) using Gram-Charlier expansion.
Gram-charlier expansion is constructed from the first four statistical moments and it allows for evaluation of density, cumulative and quantile functions.
The software tool also contains estimation of desired quantile based on semi-probabilistic characteristics typically used in Eurocodes. 
Created Gram-charlier expansion can be used for evaluation of PDF,CDF or statistical sampling via .csv files.
Finally, matplotlib module can be used for plotting of resulting probability distributions.
